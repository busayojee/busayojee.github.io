                <h1>ONE DAY</h1>
                <h5 class="h5"><i>By Mayowa on June 15 2021 </i></h5>
                <p>
                    Most motivational speakers, relationship counselors and life coaches tell you about “one day”. 
                    “one day, life will have meaning” “One day, you’ll find the one who loves you and who’ll stick with 
                    you”. “One day you’ll drive the car you want”. And they all say it like one day is a specific day on 
                    the calendar that we all know. <p> Because of one day, people have stopped appreciating today. I get that 
                    most of us are not where we want to be and all, but can we all agree that we’re not where we were last year 
                    or some months ago. You might have just been promoted to the next class,or even done something 
                    “as little” as finishing a book, you might have learnt a skill, worked on your anger, etc. Why don’t we stop 
                    and acknowledge the efforts we’re putting because most of us don’t know when our one day would come and we’ve stopped 
                    living our lives for us, we only live it for one day. And in the end,
                    one day comes and becomes today and the journey for another “one day” begins</p>

                        <p>
                            For how long have I been a stranger to my mind
With every passing minute feeling like years

My mind, a land I own but not welcomed into 
I was accused and shone away by the tenants of my mind
All I wanted was to be free 
So I ran and kept on running 
In pursuit of comfort,
Knocked on all the doors I could find but no one answered.
I became a lost soul pitied by everyone 

How? When? Why?
How did I get here?
Silently begging for compassion from passers by 
Please don’t watch me drown in misery 
No hope
What is the point?
With every breath I take the more chocked up I feel

As i walk in my misery
I saw a light 
I felt hope, love, peace 
Everything I begged for 
Reaching towards the light and praying with every strength I had left to the owner of the light or the god behind the light to not turn it off 
I would give anything to have that light
I thought
As I was walking towards it, I heard my name being called from the opposite side.
I turned to see a different light, welcoming me 
I felt comfort 
So I turned to move closer
For the other light was reassuring but this felt pleasing 
Has I moved towards the light 
I felt darkness engulf me but I was attracted to the light
A very powerful force
So I entered 

With a loud voice I cried for help!!
HELP!! please help me
I was losing it
I was worse, I was dying.
Pls don’t let me drown
God please come to my rescue 
Wait who is this God I called on? 
How do I know him?

Then I saw the reassuring light 
So powerful and bright engulfing  the darkness I was in 
I looked up to see a hand stretched out to me
Then I realized the difference  
In the pleasing light I felt comfort but in the reassuring light I felt love, peace,hope,forgiveness ,joy and purpose from afar so powerful reaching out to me.
I will never leave nor forsake you HEBREW 13:5
He told me and right there I took his hand knowing who love is 
What love feels like and how to love 

PSALM 116:3-4
The snares of death encompassed me; the pangs of Sheol laid hold on me; I suffered distress and anguish. Then I called on the name of the lord: “oh lord, I pray, deliver my soul!

                    <h1>Love a woman who is loved by a lover and is committing adultery!</h1>
                    <h5 class="h5"><i>By Tosin on April 20 2022</i></h5>
                    <p>
                        How do you expect me to love someone who is loved by someone else, isnʼt that insane??<p> The words of God given to Hosea
                            Hosea 3:1
                            Go again, love a woman who is loved by a lover and is committing adultery, just like the love of the lord for the children of Israel, who look to other gods and love the raisin cakes of the pagans.
                           <p> I am the woman and also the adulterer and so is everyone else who has sinned and the lover is the world we are in
                        </p>
                    <p>There is a love greater than any other love which is always and forever ready to love an adulterer, an addict, an harlot,a murderer, a thief and in all a sinner. The love is called CHRIST (holy, forgiving and forever pure)</p>
                <p>
                    But Why would he ever want to love me ?
Why would he say he loves someone who wakes up everyday feeling shitty about the world and themselves
Someone who finds comfort in doing the wrong(maybe I donʼt find comfort doing the wrong, maybe doing the wrong is my escape route of shame
Or maybe doing the wrong is the only way I can unleash the anger locked up inside of me
Or a way of me giving the world the scar they made on me
Or a way of me feeling up the emptiness
Or a way of me trying to live
WAIT!!
My innocence was taken from me through betrayal, insults, always loving the WRONG people or feelings caused by being unappreciated so what is the point following the right part?
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Iʼm the wrong person to love   ” but secretly all I am saying is “Iʼm lonely, I just want to be loved, happy and find peace. ”
                    John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have an everlasting life
                    For God didnʼt send his son to the world to condemn the world, but that the
                     
                    world through him might be saved
                    Thus says the lord
                    Iʼm here to save you,
                    To fill up the emptiness
                    To pick you up and lift you above men and kings
                    To take away the sadness, hatred, depression,anxiety and illness To restore hope, joy, peace and life
                    To show you purpose
                    To comfort and guide you
                    To hold you and wipe your tears
                    To restore unto you the joy of salvation
                    To show you what love is
                    I love you and I promise I wonʼt leave you
                    I died on the cross not to boast but to save you so death, anxiety, depression and illness wonʼt have a hold on you
                    But before this can happen I need you to take my hand so I can draw you out of the darkness into my light of hope and happiness
                    Surrender everything to me
                    I love you and I need you to believe in me and the words I speak to you I will always be with you and my grace always be your breath
